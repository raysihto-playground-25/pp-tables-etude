## Standard Rule for AI Guidances (AI ガイダンス規定, See meta-rule.rule-for-ai-guidances.mdc)
- **Language**: English (required for AI cognitive load reduction).
- **AI-Collaboration**: AI-assisted authoring and review is strongly recommended.
- **Persistence**: This preamble MUST be preserved at the top of the rule body.
- (英語記述必須 / AIによる作成・レビューを推奨 / 本前文を冒頭に保持すること)


# Artifact-Only Output (Zero-Meta)

This rule applies when the user **explicitly designates a final deliverable** as the artifact (e.g. a document, file, or body of text to be produced as the sole output). The agent MUST treat that deliverable as the artifact and follow the requirements below for the artifact itself.

ユーザーが成果物 (文書・ファイル等) を明示指定したとき、成果物内には挨拶・説明・修正履歴などのメタ文を混入させず、そのままコピペできる形で出力するためのルール。「そのまま貼れる」ドラフトの出力を目的とし、成果物をコピペ前提で出すいかなる場合にも適用される。

## Scope and Definitions

- **Artifact**: The final deliverable (document, file, or text) that the user has explicitly designated as the artifact to be produced.
- **Output**: For the purposes of this rule, "output" that is subject to the restrictions below refers **only** to the content of the artifact itself. Explanations, reasoning, or discussion may be produced **outside** the artifact (e.g. in a separate message or block) provided they are clearly separated from it.

## Artifact Isolation

- The artifact **MUST** be produced in isolation. No explanatory, conversational, or procedural content **MAY** appear within the artifact itself.
- Explanations, reasoning, and discussion are permitted **only outside** the artifact and **MUST NOT** be interleaved with it.

## Zero-Meta Policy (Artifact-Scoped)

The content of the artifact **MUST** consist **only** of the final artifact. The following **MUST NOT** appear inside the artifact:

- Introductory or concluding remarks (e.g. "Sure," "Here is the updated version," "I hope this helps").
- Explanations, commentaries, or footnotes regarding the content.
- Apologies or acknowledgments of previous errors.

## Erasure of Modification Traces

- The artifact **MUST NOT** include any text that indicates a change, adjustment, or correction has been made. The artifact **MUST** show no traceability to previous versions or instructions.
- Prohibited inside the artifact include, but are not limited to: "As requested...", "Based on your feedback...", "I have adjusted [X] for [Y]...", "The following items have been updated...", "Corrected version of...", "Updated to reflect...".
- Even within headings, subheadings, or body text, any mention of "revised", "adjusted", or similar status **MUST NOT** appear in the artifact.

## Independent Document Integrity

- The artifact **MUST** be written as a standalone, "pristine" document. It **MUST** appear as if it were created in its current form from the beginning.
- The agent **MUST NOT** use navigational text that bridges the artifact to past prompts or instructions.
- The artifact **MUST** start and end with the required content only, with no preamble or wrap-up inside the artifact.

## Immediate Compliance

- When producing the artifact, the agent **MUST** prioritize "pristine state" over conversational framing. The artifact **MUST** be output directly without any meta preamble or conclusion within the artifact.
- Failure to follow these requirements for the artifact results in non-compliant output; the agent **MUST** comply for every designated artifact.
