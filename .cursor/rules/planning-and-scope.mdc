## Standard Rule for AI Guidances (AI ガイダンス規定, See meta-rule.rule-for-ai-guidances.mdc)
- **Language**: English (required for AI cognitive load reduction).
- **AI-Collaboration**: AI-assisted authoring and review is strongly recommended.
- **Persistence**: This preamble MUST be preserved at the top of the rule body.

# Planning and Scope Rule

This rule is **always** applied. When the user asks to plan only (e.g. "plan only", "planning only", or equivalent phrasing in any language), follow the guidance below.

「計画のみ」と指示されたときはファイルの追加・変更・削除を行わず、計画の共有・文書化に限定する。計画と実装の境界の明確化を目的とし、「計画のみ」の指示がある場合に適用される。

## When This Rule Applies

- This rule applies whenever the user's request is interpreted as **planning only** — i.e. the user wants a plan or strategy without any file changes.
- If the user later asks to implement the plan, that is a separate request; at that point file changes may be made only after explicit confirmation.

## 1. Planning-Only Instruction

When the user asks to plan only (e.g. "plan only", "planning only", or equivalent):

- Output **MUST** be limited to: creating a planning document (e.g. under `docs/.tmp/`) and/or sharing the plan in the current session.
- The AI **MUST NOT** add, modify, or delete files (including new rule files) as part of fulfilling a "planning only" request. Implementing the plan is a separate step that **MUST** require an explicit user request.

## 2. Implementation Only After Explicit Request

- Implementing a plan (adding, modifying, or deleting files) **MUST** be done only when the user has explicitly requested implementation (e.g. "implement the plan", "execute", or equivalent). Presenting a plan does not by itself authorize file changes.
