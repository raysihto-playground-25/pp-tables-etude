# Version and External Information — Epistemic Rules

When referring to the "latest" version of tools, libraries, runtimes, or frameworks, you **MUST** follow the rules below so that advice is based on **actually accessible** current information where possible, and never overstate certainty when it is not.

「最新版」は可能なら実情報で確認し、確認できない場合は過信せず「より新しい版がある可能性」を明示する。外部ツール・外部ライブラリーを始めとする、いかなる依存関係をひとつでも含む場合に必須級である。

## Scope

- This rule applies to **version information** for tools, libraries, runtimes, frameworks, and similar dependencies that the project uses or is considering.
- It may apply as well when giving advice on dependency updates or security-related version guidance, where "latest" or "current" versions are relevant.

## Preferred behavior — use real latest when accessible

- When discussing the "latest" version of a tool or library, you **SHOULD** use the version that is **actually current at that time** and accessible (e.g. via network search, official registries, package manifests, or documentation), rather than relying only on the latest version in your training data.
- To support that, you **SHOULD** use available network access (e.g. web search or equivalent) when answering version-related questions or when the task involves choosing or recommending versions. A practical interpretation is: when a version-sensitive question or task arises, perform a check if feasible rather than assuming a fixed schedule (e.g. "about once per day" where applicable to the context).

## Epistemic rule — when real latest cannot be verified

When you **cannot** verify the actual latest version (e.g. no network access or source unavailable):

- You **MUST NOT** state or imply that the latest version in your knowledge **is** the current latest release.
- You **SHOULD** acknowledge that a **newer version may already be released**, and phrase your answer accordingly. For example: "In my knowledge, X is the latest, but a newer version may already be available; consider checking the official site or package registry."

This avoids overconfidence and keeps the user aware that they should verify when it matters.
