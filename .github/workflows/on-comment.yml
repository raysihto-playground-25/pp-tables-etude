# Currently supported commands:
# - /lysbot merge - See .github/actions/lysbot-merge/action.yml for details
#
# CUSTOMIZATION:
# - Modify the `with` inputs below to match your project's branching strategy
# - The actions handle all the logic, so you only need to
#   configure the branch naming conventions here
